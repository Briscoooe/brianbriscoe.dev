            Sourcegraph is a code-intelligence platform for helping you
            "understand, fix, and automate across all your code". There are many
            uses cases for it, such as large-scale code changes, onboarding new
            hires, better code reviews, and static code analysis. A less common
            use case which I'd like to highlight in this article is
            off-boarding.
          </p>
          <p>
            I discovered Sourcegraph not long before I left an old job where, at
            the time, I was responsible for managing a couple hundred AWS Lambda
            functions. Each was self-contained and had its own Git repo. They
            each served different purposes but one thing they all had in common
            was sending Slack notifications throughout their lifecycles so the
            relevant business functions could be informed of events happening
            across the platform. Any given day there would be hundreds of
            messages spread across various channels.
          </p>
          <p>
            When it was my time to leave the company, I realized that nobody
            knew where all of these notifications were coming from except me.
            This was a problem, as it meant that whoever was to inherit my work
            would have no idea how to maintain these services. At times a
            notification would come in and even I wouldn't know where it was
            coming from. My solution was to open my entire
            <code>~/Code</code> directory in a new VS Code window and search for
            a specific string that the message contained. This was a
            time-consuming process as the search performance was slow across
            such a large number of repos and it also depended on me having the
            correct repo locally.
          </p>
          <p>
            To add to that, the search output and filtering options in VS code
            are pretty limited. Using the
            <a href="https://github.com/calcom/cal.com">cal.com</a> repo as an
            example, here is VS code's search for <code>"user."</code> .
          </p>

            />
          </p>
          <p>
            One day by chance, not long before I was due to leave the company, I
            listened to
            <a href="https://changelog.com/founderstalk/81"
              >Quinn Slack talking about Sourcegraph on the Founders Talk
              podcast</a
            >
            and decided to give it a try. The setup as super easy - I just spun
            up an EC2 instance and ran a
            <a
              href="https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/deploy/docker-single-container#installation"
              >with a single Docker command</a
            >, connected my team's Bitbucket organization and Sourcegraph was up
            and running.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instantly, I had searchability for all notification messages across
            every repo in the company. With this new superpower, anyone on the
            team could search for a message string and find the corresponding
            repo, in a sense making the entire notification system
            self-documenting. This simplified my handover process massively as
            it meant the guys who would take over these services no longer had
            to rely on me to identify them or spend time trying to figure out
            where they came from.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is Sourcegraph's search output for the same search query I
            mentioned earlier. In addition to the common search operators, some
            extra niceties include filtering by file extension, programming
            language, and even by Git branches and history.
          </p>

            />
          </p>
          <p>
            Once I showed the team they fell in love with it and became a part
            of everyones normal workflow. Sourcegraph solved another problem for
            us that I hadn't thought of originally but upon seeing the power of
            it became so obvious: removing legacy code. We had a lot of old
            code, properties, database columns etc. that we weren't 100% sure
            weren't being used so didn't want to risk removing. With
            Sourcegraph's search we could instantly check any usages of any of
            these properties across our entire infrastructure and make an easy
            decision on whether it was safe to remove.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both of these wins were within a day or two of having installed
            Sourcegraph, and that's only scratching the surface of what it can
            do. If you haven't already, I can't recommend enough trying it out,
            it's free!
